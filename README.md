# Application Engineering and Development (INFO5100) 
**All the Projects in this repository are part of INFO5100 Application Engineering and Development course. This course was mainly taught in JAVA. All applications were developed using Java Swing.**

**Head over to README.md files within each directory for descriptive problem statements**

The following are the projects you will find it this repository:
### Assignment 1 – Create Profile
This project gives us a foundational understanding of how different system components interact with each other and how we can produce that in JAVA Swing. Here, we create a person profile and display this information using Java Swing
### Assignment 2 – Develop a Cab Management Application
The objective of this assignment is to practice managing a group of objects from creation, update, and search perspectives. In addition, you are to learn how to convert user questions to attributes on the classes, and real answers on the screen. Some of the search functions require that you find multiple instances that satisfy the search criteria. The matched elements must be collected into temporary array lists to display on the screen in a secondary table. Write an application to manage a fleet of cars for Uber in a certain geo-area.
### Assignment 3 – Design a model for University Management
The objective of this assignment is to instill in you the techniques for turning an object model into a machine for information gathering and data aggregation. We want to use software engineering techniques to improve the quality of education anywhere and hold people accountable for improving the quality of life through education, learning to learn, and feedback. Your task is to study ways to create a performance measurement solution to enable universities to measure the quality of the education they deliver to their students. The approach will be to look into how an educational system in terms of faculty and courses contribute to the growth of their graduates over a 5-year period. You must figure out ways to track the jobs and promotions graduates get over time and assign rankings accordingly. In addition, track the connection of courses and their relevance to graduates' growth.

One of your deliverables will be to design a dashboard that enables college and university administrators to compare the performance of their academic units. One additional question is to consider ways to define your own ranking system for students to decide where they want to go for their studies. The current system is biased toward research.
### Assignment 4 - Develop an application for Patient Management System
Encounter represent a visit to the doctor’s office. The vital signs timeline is linked to the encounters. Each Encounter will have a single Vital Sign component. The objective is to calculate the total number people in the community with blood pressure that is abnormal for any of the age groups. Create data for at least two communities and display abnormal cases for each community.
### Assignment 5 - Develop a Restaurant Food Delivery Management System
Develop a food delivery system with various roles within the application.
