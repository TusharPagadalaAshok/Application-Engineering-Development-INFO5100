- You’re free to have extension design based on the given model, but you’re not allowed to delete any element in the model.
- Your application is required to manage user data(CRUD). FYI: https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud
- UI&UX will be considered as a part of grade. 
- Data validation(Non-null check, basic data type check)
